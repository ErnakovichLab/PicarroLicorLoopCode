### Drawing samples from standard take, bag, or jar {#sec-appendix-two}

#### Draw standards from a tank

1.  Open the standard CO2 tank (1000 ppm), then increase the flow with the increase/decrease knob.

2.  Insert a syringe with needle & valve closed into the septa on the side of the CO2 tank, open the valve, and let your first standard amount flow into the syringe (the syringe will fill by itself, no need to pull). Always go \~2 ml over the amount you need (e.g. need 1 ml for first standard measurement, let it fill to 3 ml).

3.  Close valve of syringe before taking syringe out of septa

4.  Flush syringe to your desired ml amount

    -   Usual range: 1, 3, 5, 10, 20ml

    -   Use the 60 ml syringes to obtain the 10 and 20 ml amounts

#### Drawing Samples or Standards from a gas reservoir bag:

1.  Attach a luer lok to a syringe, but don’t yet place the needle on.
2.  Pressing firmly down on the gas reservoir, open the luer lok, and draw out 2ml of your gas standard, then detach from the bag, and pump the standard out of the syringe into the air.
3.  Reattach the luer to the gas reservoir and, pressing firmly down on the bag, withdraw gas from the bag slowly. Be careful not to create a vacuum in the syringe by pulling too hard, too fast. Always pull \~2 ml over the amount you need (e.g. need 1 ml for first standard measurement, let it fill to 3 ml).
4.  This time, close valve of syringe before taking syringe off the gas reservoir
5.  Attach the needle to the bottom of the luer lock

#### Drawing samples from an incubation jar
1. Insert a syringe with needle & luer stop-cock valve closed into the septa of your jar, open the valve, and move the plunger up and down 3 times slowly to mix the air in the jar.
2. Pull up the plunger a 4th time take your sample slightly above the ml mark for the amount you want to inject (e.g. 7ml if you want to inject 5ml)
3. Close stop-cock valve of syringe before taking syringe out of septa 
4. Open valve of syringe and push plunger down to fluxh the needle and get the exact measurment of gas you want to analyze. 
5. Close valve again
6. You can now inject the sample into the instrument or into a long-term storage gas vial

#### Drawing samples stored in a gas vial
1. Insert a syringe with needle & luer stop-cock valve closed into the septa. If the septa you are using is very thick, you may want to use a lower guage (e.g. thicker) needle.
2. open the luer lok, and draw out 2ml of your gas and shut the luer valve. 
3. Carefully pull directly up (without twisting the syringe!) to remove the needle from the vial, open the lock, pump the standard out of the syringe into the air and then re-insert it into the septa.
**note: twisting while pulling out the syringe may lead to the needle becoming detached in the septa and ruin the sample!** 
4. Withdraw the sample gas from the vial slowly. Be careful not to create a vacuum in the syringe by pulling too hard, too fast. Always pull \~2 ml over the amount you need
5. Close stop-cock valve of syringe before taking syringe out of septa (again being careful not to twist). 
6. Open valve of syringe and push plunger down to flush the needle and get the exact measurement of gas you want to analyze. 
7. Close valve again
8. You can now inject the sample into the instrument.
